            <p>
                Idle Master was created out of a simple need: to help Steam users maximize their gaming library's potential. With thousands of games offering trading cards, many gamers found themselves spending countless hours manually idling games just to collect cards. We knew there had to be a better way.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                The journey of Idle Master began when a group of passionate gamers and developers recognized the tedious process of farming Steam trading cards. We wanted to create a solution that was not only effective but also safe and user-friendly. After months of development and testing, Idle Master was born—a tool that automates the entire card farming process while maintaining the highest standards of security and reliability.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since our launch, Idle Master has helped thousands of Steam users collect and sell trading cards, earning them Steam Wallet funds to purchase new games, DLC, and in-game items. Our community continues to grow as more gamers discover the convenience and efficiency of automated card farming.
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike many third-party tools, Idle Master is built with security as a top priority.

            </p>

                We're also committed to keeping Idle Master completely free. We believe that every Steam user should have access to efficient card farming without any hidden costs or premium tiers. Our open-source approach allows the community to contribute, review, and improve the tool continuously.
